= Chronicle

This extension keeps historical versions of pages in all their statesâ€”published, hidden, draft, and reviewed.  The most recent published or hidden version is visible in live mode and the most recent version in any state is visible in dev mode.  Thus, you can work on a draft in dev mode, preview exactly how it will look, and then make it live when you are ready.

Many people overlook the dev mode feature of Radiant.  If you don't know about it, see http://wiki.radiantcms.org/How_To_Setup_Dev_Mode.  Understanding it is key to wrapping your head around Chronicle.

== Features:

* TODO Simple graph showing the change history
* TODO Roll back to a previous version by creating a new one based on it
* TODO See what changed in a given version (plain-text diff)
* TODO Integration with the Dashboard extension so you can see what has changed recently and what pages have unpublished changes (drafts ahead of published versions)
* Should be compatible with (and version the extra page attributes of) most extensions!

Someday/maybe:
* Git interface
