= Chronicle

This extension keeps historical versions of pages in all their
statesâ€”published, hidden, draft, and reviewed. The most recent published or
hidden version is visible in live mode and the most recent version (the
"current version") in any state is visible in dev mode. Thus, you can work on
a draft in dev mode, preview exactly how it will look, and then make it live
when you are ready.

== An example

Look at the revision history of the home page of example.com:

...22  23  24  25
---*---*---*---@
           ^   ^
   Published   Draft
  (live mode)  (dev mode)

If you went to example.com/ you would see version 24. If you went to
dev.example.com/ you would see version 25.

Quick terminology primer: A page "is a draft" when its status is set to Draft.
A page "has a draft" when its most current version is a draft. When a page's
current version is Published, it "does not have a draft".

Many people overlook the dev mode feature of Radiant. If you don't know about
it, see http://wiki.radiantcms.org/How_To_Setup_Dev_Mode. Understanding it is
key to wrapping your head around Chronicle.

== Features:

* TODO Simple graph showing the change history
* TODO Roll back to a previous version by creating a new one based on it
* TODO See what changed in a given version (plain-text diff)
* TODO Integration with the Dashboard extension so you can see what has
       changed recently and what pages have unpublished changes (drafts ahead
       of published versions)
* TODO Lines in the change graph showing ancestry when a page is rolled back
* TODO Versioning for snippets and layouts as well
* TODO Versioning including page attachments
* Should be compatible with (and version the extra page attributes of) most
  extensions!

Someday/maybe:
* Git interface
